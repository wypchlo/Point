# Point
A simple c++ point library made for school related purposes (and also to learn how to make readable and frequent commits)

Goals:

Make a basic Point class
Make the equals operator work properly (because it shouldn't I think idk)
Make the stream operator work properly (<< and >>)
Add an option to calculate the vector length in the point library
Add an option to add and subtract two vectors from each other
Add a vector product function accessed by the * operator
