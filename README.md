# Point
A simple c++ point library made for school related purposes (and also to learn how to make readable and frequent commits)

Goals: <br/><br/>

[DONE] Make a basic Point class <br/>
[DONE] Make the equals operator work properly (because it shouldn't I think idk) <br/>
[DONE] Make the stream operator work properly (<< and >>) <br/>
[DONE] Add an option to calculate the vector length in the point library <br/>
Add an option to add and subtract two vectors from each other <br/>
Add a vector product function accessed by the * operator <br/>

Notes:

To make the equals operator not work I will have to make the irrational choice to have the coordinates be pointers to the actual values
note that I have been given no choice here
